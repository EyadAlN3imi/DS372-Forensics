# Bloodstain Pattern Analysis (BPA) Datasets
This repository compiles three publicly available datasets covering different blood-pattern mechanisms, useful for computer vision and forensic machine-learning research.

1. Impact Beating Spatter Dataset

Link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918314689

Spatter patterns generated by striking a pool of blood using controlled mechanical rigs.
The setup allowed variation in impact speed, angle, and distance, producing realistic medium/high-energy spatter.
All patterns were scanned at 600 dpi with detailed metadata describing the experimental conditions.

2. Drip Pattern Dataset

A collection of 635 drip-type blood patterns created using whole bovine blood.
The drops were released under different indoor and outdoor conditions to capture variations in surface interaction, spread, and morphology—ideal for studying drip behavior or building drip-pattern classifiers.

3. Gunshot vs. Impact Spatter ML Dataset

Link: https://arxiv.org/html/2501.02151v1#S2

A dataset of 169 blood-spatter images covering two mechanisms:
-Gunshot backspatter
-Impact beating spatter

The accompanying study demonstrates a feature-based machine-learning approach for distinguishing between the two, achieving high classification accuracy.
