# Abstract
Bloodstain Pattern Analysis (BPA) helps us understand how bloodstains form, with a focus on their size, shape, and distribution. 
This aids in crime scene reconstruction and provides insight into victim positions and crime investigation. 
One challenge in BPA is distinguishing between different types of bloodstains, such as those from firearms, impacts, or other mechanisms. 
Our study focuses on differentiating impact spatter bloodstain patterns from gunshot bloodstain patterns. 
We distinguish patterns by extracting well-designed individual stain features, applying effective data consolidation methods, and selecting boosting classifiers.
